Prompt to Image Generator using Diffusers, Transformers, Gradio, and Accelerate
This project is a Prompt to Image Generator that leverages the power of Diffusers, Transformers, Gradio, and Accelerate to generate images based on text prompts. The application takes a user-provided prompt and uses a pre-trained model to generate images based on the description.

Project Overview
The Prompt to Image Generator enables users to input a text prompt (e.g., "a futuristic cityscape at sunset") and automatically generates an image that visually represents the description. The application integrates several advanced machine learning tools and libraries to perform the task efficiently:

Diffusers: Used to generate images based on text prompts using pre-trained diffusion models.
Transformers: Utilized for handling large language models and generating the corresponding embeddings for text.
Gradio: Creates an interactive web interface that allows users to input text prompts and view the generated images.
Accelerate: Optimizes model performance to run efficiently across different hardware configurations.
Key Features
Text-to-Image Generation: Generate high-quality images from a descriptive text prompt.
Web Interface: The project uses Gradio to provide a simple web-based interface to interact with the image generation model.
Optimized Performance: Leverages Accelerate to run models efficiently on various hardware setups.
Pre-trained Models: Uses pre-trained diffusion models to generate images based on textual descriptions.
Libraries Used
diffusers: A library for diffusion-based generative models.
transformers: Used for NLP models and integration with Hugging Face models.
gradio: A Python library for creating UIs to interact with machine learning models.
accelerate: Optimizes training and inference speed on various hardware configurations.
